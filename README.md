# General Instructions

First of all, thank you for taking the time to look at my project. 

Here you will find 2 prints, one from my Desktop and another one for a responsive Mobile version in the browser.

Upfront, I know that keys are supposed to be in a .env file. But, since this is a closed test, I've left them in the open.

# To run the project

In order to use the program, you just need to have docker installed on your machine.

If you don't have it, go to https://www.docker.com/ and download the one for your operational system.

After that, start up Docker. Then go to the root of the project, and type ```docker compose up``` and the project should start after a few moments installing everything it needs.

Then you just need to type ```www.localhost:3000``` in your browser to access it.

##Alternative path
If you don't want to use Docker, you just need node installed on your machine. Mine is version 18.17.1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en and download the LTS version, then, install it.

After that, just go to the root of the project and type ```npm install```. After installing, type ```npm start``` and it will spin up the project that will, again, be accessible via ```www.localhost:3000``` in your browser.
